            <h3>Offer Hunter and WOWS Grinder</h3>

            <p>I have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to offer finding and a drive to see things through
                to
                completion. I have more than 2 years of experience in managing and leading peopel hot to manage orders
                across multiple e-commarce. I am eager to purchese, I enjoy watching reviews, and I have a genuine
                interest
                in Order Management and making people successful.<br>
                <br>I'm a pretty calm gamer, though can be frustrated by failure quite quickly, I am competitive, one of my favourite features in a game is grinding, the more ways you can grind a ship or resourse etc to your own ends the better in my book.

                I'm great at strategy in wows but prefer to be the grunt and be told what to do, the same dosen't applies for most games. I know the game enough and played it enough to be able to lead people in it, and im the commander of the only active Bangladeshi clan BNS</p>
